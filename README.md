A fully autonomous AI-powered agent that processes daily attendance logs, detects present, absent, and late entries based on time thresholds, and generates structured Excel attendance reports—no manual work required.
Attendance Analyser Agent – A Smart, Fully Autonomous Attendance System

Welcome to the Attendance Analyser Agent – a streamlined, intelligent solution designed to revolutionise how organisations manage daily attendance. Whether you're overseeing classrooms, remote teams, or office staff, this system removes the need for manual tracking and replaces it with a fast, reliable, and fully automated process.

This Python-based agent takes raw check-in data (e.g., CSV logs with names and entry times), applies a predefined set of logical rules, and instantly determines who’s Present, Absent, or Late. It then generates a professionally structured Excel report — all without a single click or any human input.

Why Use This?
Managing attendance shouldn’t be a chore. This tool is built for real people running real operations — not tech experts. Whether you’re an educator, a team leader, or an administrator, this system allows you to save time, avoid human error, and get back to what matters.

 Key Features
Zero Manual Intervention – Once configured, the system runs on its own. No buttons to press. No spreadsheets to fill.

Human-Friendly Output – Reports are generated in clean Excel format, making them easy to read, share or archive.

Late Arrival Detection – You set the time, and the agent does the rest.

Easily Configurable – Want to adjust the 'late' threshold or change input formats? No problem.

Designed with Clarity – Clean, readable Python modules that are easy to understand and adapt.

Real-World Use Cases
Schools & Universities – Keep track of student attendance automatically from sign-in logs.

Remote & Office Teams – Monitor team check-ins in hybrid work environments.

HR & Payroll Departments – Maintain accurate daily attendance records with zero effort.

IT & DevOps Pipelines – Seamlessly plug into scheduled tasks, cron jobs, or workflow automation tools.

Built for the Future
This agent isn’t just a script — it’s the foundation for a smarter attendance ecosystem. Its modular structure means it can be extended with ease: integrate it with biometric systems, cloud storage, or even notification bots. It's lightweight, dependable, and built for real-world scale.
